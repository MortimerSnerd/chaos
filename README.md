# Chaos
Small collection of data structures in Nim.  Some I need, others are for review or learning.

# LICENSE
MIT.  I'd be interested to hear if you use anything, but it's not required.

# Modules
* `bplustree` - B+ tree based on blocks that can be in memory, or on disk.  Initial implementation, alpha quality, wastes memory, needs tests.  Slightly radioactive.
